# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate

This repository showcases my progress and achievements from completing the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera. The certificate consists of 12 courses designed to equip learners with the necessary skills in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

## Tools and Technology Used

The courses in this certificate series introduced and used the following tools and technologies:

- **Python** – Programming language used extensively throughout the courses for data science and machine learning.
- **Jupyter Notebooks** – Tool for writing and running Python code in an interactive, exploratory manner.
- **Pandas** – A Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Libraries for data visualization in Python.
- **SQL** – Query language for managing and analyzing data in databases.
- **IBM Cloud** – Platform for data science and AI development.

## Achievements

I have successfully completed the following courses as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate:

1. **What is Data Science?**
2. **Python for Data Science, AI & Development**
3. **Python Project for Data Science**
4. **Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python**
5. **Data Analysis with Python**
6. **Data Visualization with Python**
7. **Machine Learning with Python**

Each course provided hands-on learning and real-world applications of the concepts, laying a strong foundation for my future work in data science and machine learning.

I look forward to completing the remaining courses in the series and applying the skills acquired to real-world projects.
